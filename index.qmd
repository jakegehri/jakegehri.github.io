## Bio
My name is Jake Gehri. I am from Buckley, WA and currently reside in New York City, where I work as an Investment Banking Analyst for Rothschild & Co. I graduated from Yale University in 2022 where I majored in Economics and Global affairs, and played on the Yale Baseball team. 

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and am self-taught in (mostly) everything I know about it. I am looking to pursue graduate studies in computer science (artificial intelligence) in the near future.
